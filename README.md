# Imvr

An image veiwer for all platforms, allowing for remote control. Designed to be 
a terminal image program that isn't a band-aid like ueberzugg but rather an 
alternative option to trying to patch something into a 40 year old technology. 
It is primarily designed to embedable in applications but also should be great 
for just personal use and scripting.
